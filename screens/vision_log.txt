VISION: The image shows a person holding a smartphone in front of their face.  The phone is light-colored, possibly light blue or gray, and has a triple-lens camera visible on the back. The person's face is mostly obscured by the phone, only the top of their forehead and hair are visible.  The person appears to have dark hair. The background is a wall with a light-colored, patterned wallpaper featuring a repeating floral or damask design in muted gold/beige tones.  The lighting is somewhat dim. There is a suggestion of a dark piece of furniture (possibly a bed) at the bottom of the image.
