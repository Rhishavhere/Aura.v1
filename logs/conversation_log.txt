User Prompt: why is the sky blue
Function Call: None
Visual Context: None
AI Response: "Aura, the color of the sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the shorter, blue wavelengths of light more than the longer, red wavelengths, which is why the sky typically appears blue during the day."

User Prompt: what do you see on my screen
Function Call: take screenshot
Visual Context: The image shows a screen capture of a Visual Studio Code window.  The user is running a Python program named `main.py`. The program appears to be designed to log conversations, including user prompts, function calls, visual context, and AI responses.  The `main.py` file contains code that is currently being debugged because the log file is empty despite the file existing. The user has asked: "what do you see on my screen". The current log file entry shows a previous interaction where the user asked "why is the sky blue".  The program's output area shows a terminal window where the program was launched via `python main.py`. The file explorer shows various files and folders associated with the project.  The code editor shows a corrected version of the `save_conversation` function which is intended to fix a bug preventing log file population.
