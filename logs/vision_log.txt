VISION: The image shows a person holding a smartphone.  The phone is held vertically and takes up a significant portion of the frame. The screen is dark, making the content unidentifiable. The phone appears to be a relatively modern rectangular model with a dark bezel.

The person holding the phone is partially visible; only their hand and a portion of their face, obscured by a dark hooded sweatshirt, are seen.  The background is a patterned wallpaper in gold and beige tones. The lighting in the image is dim.
