# **AURA.v1**

*`Under Development`*



**AURA** (Advanced Unsupervised Reinforcement Architecture) is a multi-modal `PERSONA` based AI assistant designed to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. This project represents the foundational development of AURA, establishing its core architecture..


## Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Input Processing**: AURA can analyze and respond to:
  - Text prompts
  - Screenshots
  - Webcam captures
  - Clipboard content
  - Voice input
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Utilizes visual and textual context to generate relevant responses
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Processes user inputs and provides immediate feedback
- **Privacy-First Design**: All processing is done locally with no data collection
- **Voice Interaction**: Supports both text and voice input/output

## Current Capabilities

- **Visual Context Analysis**:
  - Screenshot interpretation
  - Webcam image processing
- **Text Processing**:
  - Clipboard content analysis
  - Voice-to-text conversion
  - Text-to-speech response generation
- **Contextual Understanding**:
  - Maintains conversation history
  - Integrates multiple input sources
  - Automatic function calling for context capture
- **Conversation Management**:
  - Conversation history clearing
  - Conversation logging
  - Help command for available features

## Technical Specifications

- **AI Models**:
  - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Latest) for vision and function calling
  - AuraLLama for text generation
- **Dependencies**:
  - Google Generative AI
  - Ollama
  - OpenCV
  - Pillow
  - Pyperclip
  - Pyttsx3
  - SpeechRecognition
  - python-dotenv


## Future Development

AURA is currently in active development with plans to implement:

- **Enhanced Voice Interaction**:
  - More natural voice recognition
  - Improved voice response generation
- **Expanded Functionality**:
  - System integration
  - Task automation
  - API connectivity
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**:
  - Real-time object recognition
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Predictive assistance
  - Multi-turn conversation optimization

## Disclaimer

AURA is currently in development and may have limited functionality. The current implementation represents only a fraction of the intended capabilities. Users should expect significant updates and improvements in future versions.
